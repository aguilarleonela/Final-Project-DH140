# Final Project DH140 Assignment 

## Research Question 
  > My research topic will focus on veganism in the United States. How has the accesibility of vegan foods contribute to the popularity of the vegan lifetyle in the United States ? Is there a particular reason for this growing trend ? 

 ## Why it Matters 
  > As a vegan myself, accessibilty to vegan foods can be challenging but rewarding. I believe we should bring more awareness about the vegan lifestyle and its  environmental/health benefits. In addition, the rising trend of veganism goes hand in hand with the increasing number of products offered for people with food allergies or other dietary restrictions. For example, several Americans are lactose intolerant which accounts for the rise of plant-based milk consumption.  This rise in selective eating habits (due to allergies or diet trends)  has created a massive demand and change within the food market. Veganism is becoming a popular life style in the United States. 

## Sources 
  > The sources I intend to use for this project is Kaggle which is a data set website available to the public. The specific data set I am observing is 
  [Kaggle/Vegan & Vegetarian Restaurants in the U.S](https://www.kaggle.com/datafiniti/vegetarian-vegan-restaurants) 
  > This data set explores a list of restaurants in the U.S that offers these options. I plan to find more relevant data sets using the [Google Data Set](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/) search engine. 

## Data Visuals
  > I intend to use this data set to create visualizations using Python mapping the data. By creating geographical maps, I can pinpoint the popularity of veganism among certain communities. In California, for example, vegan restaurants are much more popular compared to states in the Midwest. Vegan good availability affects vegan consumption. Therefore, I hope to create maps to showcase vegan trends in certain areas and run comparisons. 

## Relevant Findings 
 > The findings I expect to find is where veganism is specifically popular. I expect to highlight how corporations and businesses are becoming more inclusive and aware of vegan diets. Already, we can see how veganism is readily accessible in Los Angeles compared to other cities. By creating maps, I also expect to see several vegan trends in metropolitan areas where veganism tends to be more demanding. I also hope to connect my findings on the importance of veganism and why these options should be accessible everywhere.
